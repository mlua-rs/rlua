# Builds the correct version of Lua 5.4 inside the crate. If you want to link a
# specialized version of lua into your binary, you can disable this feature to
# do that, but care must be taken.  `rlua` makes at least the following
# assumptions about the linked lua library:
#   * LUA_INTEGER is long long
#   * LUA_NUMBER as double
#   * LUA_EXTRASPACE is at least pointer sized and has at least pointer alignment.
#   * LUAI_MAXSTACK is 1_000_000

# Uses pkg-config to find an appropriate lua 5.{1,3,4} library to link with as
# specified.  The caveats about disabling the default builtin-lua feature apply
# here as well.  If neither the builtin-lua* nor the system-lua* feature is
# enabled, then no lua library will be linked at all and one must be linked
# with or built into the final binary manually.  The builtin-lua* and system-lua*
# features are mutually exclusive and enabling both will cause an error at
# build time.
