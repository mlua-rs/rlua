[features]
default = ["builtin-lua"]
# Builds the correct version of Lua 5.3 inside the crate. If you want to link a
# specialized version of lua into your binary, you can disable this feature to
# do that, but care must be taken.  `rlua` makes at least the following
# assumptions about the linked lua library:
#   * LUA_INTEGER is long long
#   * LUA_NUMBER as double
#   * LUA_EXTRASPACE is at least pointer sized and has at least pointer alignment.
#   * LUAI_MAXSTACK is 1_000_000
builtin-lua = ["cc"]
# Uses pkg-config to find an appropriate lua 5.3 library to link with.  All of
# the caveats about disabling the default builtin-lua feature apply here as
# well.  If neither the builtin-lua nor the system-lua feature is enabled, then
# no lua library will be linked at all and one must be linked with or built into
# the final binary manually.  The builtin-lua and system-lua features are
# mutually exclusive and enabling both will cause an error at build time.
