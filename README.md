[Guided Tour](examples/guided_tour.rs)

This library is a high level interface between Rust and Lua.  Its major goals
are to expose as easy to use, practical, and flexible of an API between Rust and
Lua as possible, while also being *completely* safe.

`rlua` is NOT designed to be a perfect zero cost wrapper over the Lua C API,
because such a wrapper cannot maintain the safety guarantees that `rlua` is
designed to have.  Every place where the Lua C API may trigger an error longjmp
in any way is protected by `lua_pcall`, and the user of the library is protected
from directly interacting with unsafe things like the Lua stack, and there is
overhead associated with this safety.  However, performance *is* a focus of the
library to the extent possible while maintaining safety, so if you encounter
something that egregiously worse than using the Lua C API directly, or simply
something you feel could perform better, feel free to file a bug report.

## API stability

This library is very much Work In Progress, so there is a some API churn.
Currently, it follows a pre-1.0 semver, so all API changes should be accompanied
by 0.x version bumps.

The new 0.16 release has a particularly *large* amount of API breakage which
were required to fix several long-standing limitations and bugs.  The biggest
change by far is that most API usage now takes place through `Lua::context`
callbacks rather than directly on the main `Lua` state object.  See the
changelog information about other API changes, and also see the guided tour for
an example of using the new `Context` API.

## Safety and Panics

The goal of this library is complete safety, it should not be possible to cause
undefined behavior whatsoever with the API, even in edge cases.  There is,
however, QUITE a lot of unsafe code in this crate, and I would call the current
safety level of the crate "Work In Progress".  Still, unsoundness is considered
the most serious kind of bug, so if you find the ability to cause UB with this
API *at all* without `unsafe`, please file a bug report.

Another goal of this library is complete protection from panics: currently, it
should not be possible for a script to trigger a panic.  There ARE however
several internal panics in the library, but triggering them should be considered
a bug.  Similarly to the safety goal, the current panic safety of this library
is still "Work In Progress", but if you find a way to trigger internal panics,
please file a bug report.

Yet another goal of the library is to, in all cases, safely handle panics
generated by Rust callbacks.  Panic unwinds in Rust callbacks should currently
be handled correctly -- the unwind is caught and carried across the Lua API
boundary as a regular Lua error in a way that prevents Lua from catching it.
This is done by overriding the normal Lua 'pcall' and 'xpcall' with custom
versions that cannot catch errors that are actually from Rust panics, and by
handling panic errors on the receiving Rust side by resuming the panic.

`rlua` should also be panic safe in another way as well, which is that any `Lua`
instances or handles should remain usable after a user triggered panic, and such
panics should not break internal invariants or leak Lua stack space.  This is
mostly important to safely use `rlua` types in Drop impls, as you should not be
using panics for general error handling.

In summary, here is a list of `rlua` behaviors that should be considered a bug.
If you encounter them, a bug report would be very welcome:

  * If you can cause UB at all with `rlua` without typing the word "unsafe",
    this is absolutely 100% a bug.
  * If your code panics with a message that contains the string "rlua internal
    error", this is a bug.
  * The above is true even for the internal panic about running out of stack
    space!  There are a few ways to generate normal script errors by running out
    of stack, but if you encounter a *panic* based on running out of stack, this
    is a bug.
  * If you load the "debug" library (which requires typing "unsafe"), the safety
    and panic guarantees goes out the window.  The debug library can be used to
    do extremely scary things.  If you use the debug library and encounter a
    bug, it may still very well be a bug, but try to find a reproduction that
    does not involve the debug library first.
  * When the internal version of Lua is built using the `gcc` crate, and
    `cfg!(debug_assertions)` is true, Lua is built with the `LUA_USE_APICHECK`
    define set.  Any abort caused by this internal Lua API checking is
    *absolutely* a bug, and is likely to be a soundness bug because without
    `LUA_USE_APICHECK` this would likely instead be UB.
  * Lua C API errors are handled by lonjmp.  *ALL* instances where the Lua C API
    would longjmp should be protected from Rust, except in internal callbacks
    where this is intentional.  If you detect that `rlua` is triggering a
    longjmp over your Rust stack frames, this is a bug!
  * If you can somehow handle a panic in a Rust callback from Lua, this is a
    bug.
  * If you detect that, after catching a panic or during a Drop triggered from a
    panic, a `Lua` or handle method is triggering other bugs or there is a Lua
    stack space leak, this is a bug.  `rlua` instances are supposed to remain
    fully usable in the face of user triggered panics.  This guarantee does not
    extend to panics marked with "rlua internal error" simply because that is
    already indicative of a separate bug.

## Sandboxing and Untrusted Scripts

The API currently contains the pieces necessary to implement simple, limited
"sanboxing" of Lua scripts by controlling their environment, limiting their
allotted VM instructions, and limiting the amount of memory they may allocate.

These features deserve a few words of warning: **do not use them to run
untrusted scripts unless you really Know What You Are Doing (tm), and even then,
you probably should not do that**.

First, this library contains a *shocking* amount of unsafe code, and I currently
*would not trust it in a truly security sensitive context*.  There are almost
certainly bugs still lurking in this library!  It is surprisingly, fiendishly
difficult to use the Lua C API without the potential for unsafety.

Second, PUC-Rio Lua is a C library not *really* designed to be used with
malicious scripts.  Please understand that though PUC-Rio Lua is an extremely
well written language runtime, it is still quite a lot of C code, and it is not
commonly used with truly malicious scripts.  Take a look
[here](https://www.lua.org/bugs.html) and count how many known bugs resulted in
crashes in the interpreter.  Another small example: did you know there is a way
to attack Lua tables to cause linear complexity in the table length operator?
That this still counts as one VM instruction?

Third, if you provide an API to scripts, it can be very very difficult to secure
that API.  Do all of your API functions have some maximum runtime?  Do any of
your API functions allow the script to allocate via Rust?  Are there limits on
how much they can allocate this way?  All callback functions still count as a
single VM instruction!

Fourth, especially in the context of sharing the environment across separate
sandboxed scripts, properly sandobxing can be quite difficult.  Some information
on this can be found [here](http://lua-users.org/wiki/SandBoxes).

In any case, sandboxing in this way may still be useful to protect against buggy
(but non-malicious) scripts, and may even serve as a single *layer* of a larger
security strategy, but it may never be appropriate by itself to run untrusted
Lua code.
